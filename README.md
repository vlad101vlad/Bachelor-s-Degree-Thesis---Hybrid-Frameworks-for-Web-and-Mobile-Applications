# Bachelor's Degree Thesis
## Hybrid Frameworks for Web and Mobile Applications:

In the fast-paced environment that we currently live in, every resource is becoming
scarcer, especially time. Thus, similar to other domains, methods of making the
time we have more efficient and more profitable are constantly being developed,
the community of software developers came up with their own solutions. One of
those solutions is the use of hybrid frameworks for deploying the same projects on
multiple platforms with the promise of only one codebase.
The aim of this paper is to present how this solution was inevitable to come
and to show the current options a developer has if one chooses to take this path.
Across multiple chapters, this thesis provides a detailed view of the internal architecture
of the most popular hybrid frameworks at the moment as well as present
important similarities and differences between them. In addition, it gives recommendations
about important factors to take into account when choosing between
different options of technologies as well as showcase how multiple building blocks
come together in a practical application in the form of an online shop with the help
of the Ionic framework .

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Ionic, Capacitor, Cordova, Firebase Database/Storage/Authentication

For this application, the main use case is selling pizza(s) (or any other product/
service a business would want to sell). The complexity of this project is not necessarily
in the logic and heavy computation that are taking place, but rather in the
design and the architecture of the application, as well as finding fast and reliable
ways of producing a high-quality application using as few resources as possible.
